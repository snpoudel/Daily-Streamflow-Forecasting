#code for hbv foreccasting model
#that takes calibrated parameters, initial conditions and forecast inputs to forecast streamflow
#for this calibrate the model first, then re-run the calibrated model for the recent input data
#to prepare the initial conditions for the model and then forecast streamflow for the next 28 days
