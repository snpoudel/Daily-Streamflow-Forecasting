Plots Ideas:
1 Map showing basin area
1 Methods plots
3 Model summary performance plots
4 Model forecast 1 3 5 7 15 28 days plots (first row has all model for 1 day...)
5 Model forecast 1 2 5 10 20 yrs return period plots (similar plot as above...)
6 Time taken by different model plot
7 Result for one single basin
- time series of observed vs forecast
- time series of rmse or nse

8 Now show results under future precip uncertainty
- result showing how model foreast accuracy changes with error in future precip forecast (1mm, 2mm, 3mm, etc...)


Things to take care!
- need to correct hbv_sarima first!!
- then need to double check why we are not seeing a consistent declines in performance as we increase precip error!!
